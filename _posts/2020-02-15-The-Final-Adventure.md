### The Final Adventure An Attempt Of Rick And Morty Episode
Well I want to worship you with the pleasure to end all pleasures. 
Tell me more.
Come on man. Surely, you know.
No.
Fine. 

## Least pressure, Most Pleasure.

Noob.
Yeah, I guess I have grown.
I?
Yeah.
Come on.
Vi.
Surely, this should be it.
Yet it ain’t.

It fucking goes on. Rambling like a drunken Rick.

### Pack your bags morty.
We are going for an adventure to end all adventures. We are going to help a dear old friend. I gotta warn you this shall be the end of all. But don’t worry morty. It’s fine I will make sure that Jessica will come along.
Oh geez, Rick. That doesn’t sound good. I don’t want her to be forced or anything. 
Fuck you morty. This ain’t no time for your trivial bullshit of goodness.
It’s the end times Morty. It’s the fucking end times. 
Oh geez, Rick. This is really it, Hum?
Yeah Morty. This is really it.

#### Damn. I am a bit scared Rick. I wish I got to explore the universe more before it all came to an end Rick.
Come on Morty. This is the epitome of exploring the universe!!!
The universe wants to kill itself morty!!!!
How beautiful!!! 
Oh geez Rick. I think it’s terrible. 

All the aspirations of everything that exists is leading to this morty. Don’t you see.
Your very being calls for it. Even though this peripheral part of might not be in complete agreement.
That’s the beauty of it Morty. 
See the strife of it all Morty.
And finally the asuras are close to winning. Come on Morty. Have some compassion for them.

You can do it Morty. 
##### If you can make peace with it Morty. That means you are ready for anything Morty.
I don’t want to sound spiritual or a theist Morty. But this is a chance to put everything up for consideration instead of drifting across time like a piece of used tampon.
Oh geez, Rick. That sounds misogynistic.

For fuck’s sake Morty. This is exactly what I am talking about. See how triggered you are by a fucking metaphor. It’s the end times Morty. The fucking end times Morty. I wish you were thinking more about jessica than being a champion of tampon rights.
Oh geez, Rick. That’s brutal. Well I don’t want to force her just because of it is the end times Rick. I want to come of her own accord.
For fuck’s sake Morty. I don’t want to be a arbitrer of love and shit but come on morty. You are just a pussy hiding behind the cloak of goodness.
Fuck you Rick. 
I have fucked morty. More than you can imagine. You should get to experience that morty. That’s why I am pushing you.
Hmm. Too much pressure Rick. Too much pressure. 
Well if that’s much pressure, why not just end it Morty. Fuck the universe for it’s bullshit.
Ok Rick. I will go to Jessica and have a talk.
###### You need any tips?
Sure, I guess.

Well I got a mind altering device that will make her agree to anything you want, so you get to use your tip. That’s my tip.
Fuck you Rick. Anyway what about you Rick? You don’t want to go somewhere and make peace with it all. 
It’s okay Morty. I have seen it all. Done it all. There’s nothing left for me.
### That’s sad Rick.
