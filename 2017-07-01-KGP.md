Oh boy, lot has happened since I last blabbered (read blobbered) on about. I
really need to be something else, yet here I am. I actually started writing about YouPlay, a soon to be opensourced console interface to play youtube videos natively (mpv) optimised to my vim and i3 needs. I kept that on the back
burner. Want to open source once it's polished (could be a while, so ping me if
        you are interested about it (sourya4@gmail.com)).

This is not an exhaustive list. Will keep updating this as I keep remembering
stuff. Self documenting is very important for me as I have an affinity to go
insane once in a while ;) At the same time, I ain't opensourcing everything,
need some closed stuff in my arsenal (jk, just to freak people out).

This post will serve as a DONE list of my 5 years at IIT Kharagpur. People
who know me how I have transformed over these 5 years while trying to keep the
inner monkey alive. I will avoid refering to anyone as people reading this will
know the parts during which I have intereacted with them.
