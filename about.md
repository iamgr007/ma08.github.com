I am a 3rd Year Computer Science Undergrad student at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).
My skills include `C`, `CPP`, `Python`, `Java`, `Bash`, `Javascript` in no particular order.

Recently as an intern at a startup, I have been a part of a team which built a webapp using [MEAN Stack](http://mean.io/).
It is a great development enviornment, challenging the traditional `LAMP` stack. 
I have worked on the server side. I think I can say that I know my way around [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB]()( `NoSQL` ftw!!) and some passing knowledge of [Angular](https://angularjs.org/).

I would love to work on `MEAN Stack`/`Node`/`MongoDB` again(`without pay` if it's opensource!!). If you have got interesting ideas for a webapp, please [drop me a mail](mailto:sourya4@gmail.com).

I am a passionate `Linux` user and devoted [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)mer. Be sure to expect some blob posts on these.

####Opensource
If you have got an opensource project and need someone with a skillset mildly resembling the above mentioned, please [contact me](mailto:sourya4@gmail.com). I am an ardent supporter of opensource and freesoftware, but still haven't kicked of on any project yet(sounds a bit lame, ain't it).

####Football - Gooner for Ever.
I love football. I support the [Arsenal](http://arsenal.com), the one and only club.
