I am a 4th Year Computer Science Undergrad student at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).
My skills include `C`, `CPP`, `Python`, `Java`, `Bash`, `Javascript` in no particular order.
I am a passionate `GNU/Linux` user and devoted [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)mer. Be sure to expect some blob posts on these.

####Football - Gooner for Ever.
I love football. I support the [Arsenal](http://arsenal.com), the one and only club.
